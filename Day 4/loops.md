## Python Loops:
1. For Loop: It is used to iterate over a sequence such as a list, string, or a range of numbers.
2. While Loop: It continues to execute as long as a condition is True.
3. If Else Loop: In Python, the if statement runs a block of code when a condition is True. If the condition is False, the else block runs. This helps programs make decisions based on conditions.

   The examples are given in loop.py file for each type.
